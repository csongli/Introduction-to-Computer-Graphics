# Introduction-to-Computer-Graphics

This repository contains applications developed during my university computer graphics course. I've used the GLUT library and the two examples are: 
* Bezier and Hermite curve viewing application, where users can view how modifying the base points affect these two curves
* A 3D graphical application containing a shaded torus and two projection options
